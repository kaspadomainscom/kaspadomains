          What is KaspaDomains?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong className="text-white">KaspaDomains.com</strong> is a decentralized on-chain experiment featuring a fixed collection of <strong>10,000 unique <code className="text-kaspa-green">.kas</code> domains</strong>. 
          These domains are not for sale but open for <strong>community-powered voting</strong>. By participating, you help build a transparent reputation layer on Kaspa while earning rewards, shaping the future of decentralized digital identity.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-2">How It Works</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Anyone can vote for a domain by paying a fixed fee of <span className="font-semibold text-kaspa-green">5 KAS</span>. Each vote triggers a minting process:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-200">
          <li>You receive a variable amount of <strong className="text-white">KDC tokens</strong> as a reward, starting at 1 KDC per vote.</li>
          <li>The domain owner simultaneously receives the same amount of KDC tokens for free as a reward.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          The KDC token reward halves every <strong>525,000 votes</strong>, reducing by half each time (for example, from 1 KDC to 0.5 KDC). This halving continues until the maximum supply of 2.1 million KDC tokens is reached, encouraging early participation.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-2">What Are KDC Tokens?</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          <strong>KDC</strong> is the native ERC-20 reward token earned through voting. It reflects your participation in KaspaDomains. 
          There is a fixed maximum supply of 2.1 million tokens, minted exclusively through voting‚Äîthere is no premine or developer allocation.
          The protocol is intentionally minimal and focused on transparency and fairness.
